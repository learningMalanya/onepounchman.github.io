Welcome! I am a second-year Statistics PhD student at [University of California Irvine](https://www.stat.uci.edu). Previously, I studied Biostatistics as a master student at the [University of Washington](https://www.biostat.washington.edu). Prior to UW, I received my BSc in Applied Mathematics from [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/). My current research focuses on Causal Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Previously I did some work on statistical modeling for neuroimaging.
